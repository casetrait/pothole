# Overview
**Route Ticket** was developed to connect infrustructure planners with their citizens to provide improved and inexpensive data for roadway and infrastructure maintenance and planning.

---
# Navigating the App

Users can create an account and report issues along their route by opening a new "Route Ticket". Whether it be potholes, snow obstructions, poor signage or other concerns, Users can report a unique issue by selecting "New Ticket" and providing details including map position.

If the issue of concern already has an active ticket it will appear on the map. A user can filter, expand ticket headers to view details and cast a confirmation vote on the ticket to improve validation and imply additional urgency to resolve the issue. Similarily, users can vote on tickets that are resolved to assist with an active status and filtering algorithm.
